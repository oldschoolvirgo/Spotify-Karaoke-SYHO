    About Me 
    <br>
    My system features top-notch prosumer equipment, including four Shure wireless microphones, two JBL loudspeakers, a powerful subwoofer, multiple DJ lighting fixtures, a truss system, and a fog machine. 
    <br>
    One of the highlights of my setup is a dedicated laptop that allows guests to search and queue their own song requests. We've also extended feature this to your own personal device!
    <br>
    Imagine a party where attendees can curate the music choices and sing along if they wishâ€”this is exactly the experience I offer. 
    <br>
    My audio source is Spotify, with playlists covering a wide range of eras and genres. These playlists feature the original versions of the songs, complete with lead vocals, ensuring there's always great music playing, whether someone is singing or not.
    <br>
    The wireless microphones provide the freedom to move around and engage with the space, making the experience enjoyable from anywhere, even a barstool. With four microphones, everyone can join in the fun.
    <br>
    Sing your heart out underneath the bright lights and make memories that will last a lifetime!
